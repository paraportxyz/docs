## Quick Start for Builders

### 1. Install the SDK

ParaPort ships as framework-specific packages that share a TypeScript core. Install the package that matches your stack:

```bash
npm install @paraport/core @paraport/vue      # Vue 3
npm install @paraport/core @paraport/react    # React 18+
```

The core package exposes shared services, while the UI package provides drop-in components and hooks.

### 2. Configure Supported Networks

Initialize ParaPort with the parachains and assets you want to support. Configuration files for Polkadot Hub, AssetHub, Hydration, and People chain are available in `packages/statick`.

```ts
import { createParaPort } from '@paraport/core'
import { hydration, assetHub, polkadotHub } from '@paraport/statick'

export const paraport = createParaPort({
  chains: [polkadotHub, assetHub, hydration],
  defaultAsset: 'DOT',
  telemetry: true
})
```

### 3. Embed the UI Flow

Drop the pre-built modal or inline flow into your dApp. ParaPort handles intent detection, teleport execution, and transaction bundling.

```tsx
import { TeleportFlow } from '@paraport/react'

<TeleportFlow
  client={paraport}
  intent={{
    action: 'mint',
    chain: 'assetHub',
    params: { collectionId: '999', price: '12.5' }
  }}
/>
```

### 4. Test End-to-End

Use the provided testing guidelines to simulate partial teleports, endpoint degradation, and signature failures. ParaPort ships with mocks and contract fixtures to help you validate flows before production launches.

ParaPort only requires wallet signaturesâ€”no additional custody or key management. When teleport capacity is insufficient, users receive guided recovery steps instead of silent failures.

## What You Get Out of the Box

- **Intent detection** that triggers teleports before business logic executes
- **Unified balance view** across configured parachains
- **Automatic fee estimation** with configurable safety margins
- **Wallet-agnostic signing** that works with Talisman, SubWallet, Nova, and Ledger
- **Observability hooks** for logging, metrics, and session replay
