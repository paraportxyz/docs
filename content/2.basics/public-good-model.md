## Building as a Public Good

ParaPort is designed as shared infrastructure for any parachain team to adopt. The SDK, documentation, and reference flows are open to the ecosystem with the goal of accelerating cross-chain user experiences.

### Principles
- **Open Source First** — Core libraries and statics remain MIT licensed.
- **Transparent Funding** — Treasury grants and ecosystem support are reinvested into features, testing, and maintenance.
- **Community Alignment** — Feedback loops with wallets, parachains, and builders guide the roadmap.

## Sustainable Operations

### Revenue Streams
- Joint ecosystem grants for strategic integrations
- White-label deployments for parachains that need bespoke journeys
- Advisory and integration services for teams adopting ParaPort

### Reinforcement
All revenue is cycled back into:
- Expanding supported parachains and assets
- Hardening reliability through QA and observability
- Producing developer tooling, recipes, and workshops
- Community incentives for documentation, testing, and demos

## Ecosystem Impact

- **Unified UX** for teleports and cross-chain actions across Polkadot
- **Lower integration cost** for new dApps entering the ecosystem
- **Faster onboarding** for users who don’t want to juggle multiple bridges
- **Standardized best practices** for balance monitoring, retries, and fee handling

## Governance & Collaboration

- Open roadmap synced with [Milestone 1](https://github.com/exezbcz/paraport/milestone/1)
- Regular syncs with advisory partners and early adopters
- Transparent release notes and changelog for every SDK update
- Community calls and hackathon support planned post-Milestone 1

ParaPort embodies the Polkadot vision of interoperability: specialized parachains connected by invisible infrastructure that feels native to every user.
